Kickstarter-Analysis

The analysis of Kickstarter is that therater count for the most successful campagins, Journelism counts for the less least favorable campagins and technology had an equal amount of successful campagins. 

Overall, the Kickstarter campagins relaize on many factors for it success, it depends on the industry and how well it can appeal to the contributers of the campagin. 

The conslusion I have drawn from the limited data given that being entertainment it is easier to generate revune from a Kickstater campgain. What I would suggest is to do further analysis on the artists, what donors get from their contributions, the impact to fans, and will the events be annual.
